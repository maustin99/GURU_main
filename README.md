<h1> Approach Taken:</h1>
<h4> Order of events: </h4>
<p>We began by working on our models which comprised of the User Model which encompassed the Guru, Studio and Activities model.  Next we built the user login form as well as authenticating the user.  We then created the "Mongoose" database as well as developing the routes in further depth. After that we completed our models and had our MVP up and running by Thursday evening.  </p>
